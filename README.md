# Tuber
Tuber, 1st Place winner of the 2016 [Abilities Hackathon](abilitieshackathon.com) lets you hail an Uber ride with just a regular landline or cell phone (no smartphone app required)

# Inspiration
Older adults and people who prefer not to use, or who can't afford smart-phones have limited access to social and health resources.  Transporation is a major factor with accessing these resources.

## Current Prototype
The current prototype is hosted here: [Tuber](https://tuberino.herokuapp.com).
The goal is to build this out for unique community organizations to use.
